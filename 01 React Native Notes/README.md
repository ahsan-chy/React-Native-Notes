## **Why React Native?**

- New **JSI** (Javascript Interface)
- TurboModules
- Fabric
- HotReloading

![why-react-native](./assets/why-react-native.png)

### üîó **JSI (JavaScript Interface)**

JSI is the bridge-less communication layer between JavaScript and native code. It's super fast and unlocks next-gen features like TurboModules and Fabric.

---

### ‚ö° **TurboModules**

These are the upgraded version of native modules. They load on demand, which makes your app start faster and use memory more efficiently.

---

### üßµ **Fabric**

Fabric is the new rendering engine. It's faster, more flexible, and supports better UI threading ‚Äî so your app feels smoother and more responsive.

---

### üîÅ **HotReloading**

This is your dev-time BFF. It reloads only the changed files while preserving the app's state ‚Äî which means faster debugging and less frustration.

---

- For larger list and smooth scrolling

##### When should you use map?

- For small lists

## Project setup

Sure! Here's a clean title-only outline:

---

üìò Project Setup Outline

1. Create and Start a New Project
2. Reset Project (Get a Fresh App Structure)
3. Install Required Packages
4. Initialize Tailwind Configuration
5. Create Global CSS File
6. Add Babel Preset
7. Customize Metro Config
8. Import Global CSS
9. Update `app.json`
10. Create `nativewind-env.d.ts` File

### [Create Project](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project/)

```javascript
npx create-expo-app@latest
```

- Start the app

```javascript
npx expo start
```

- If you get this error‚ö†Ô∏è then run code like this `something went wrong sorry about that. you can go back to expo home or try to reload the project`
- [Having problems](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/start-developing/#having-problems)

```javascript
npx expo start --tunnel
```

- Use the `--clear` flag to clear the Metro bundler cache and resolve potential build or runtime issues:

```javascript
npx expo start --clear
```

- You can run project on **[android, Web, Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/linking/android-app-links/)**

#### Get a fresh project - Reset Project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

### 1. Install packages

- `nativewind` - `tailwindcss` - `react-native-reanimated` - `react-native-safe-area-context`

- [Documentation Link](https://www.nativewind.dev/getting-started/installation)

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Always check the documentation for compatible versions

```javascript
npm install nativewind tailwindcss@^3.4.17 react-native-reanimated@3.16.2 react-native-safe-area-context
```

### 2. Setup Tailwind CSS

- Run **`npx tailwindcss init`** to create a **`tailwind.config.js`** file

- Add the paths to all of your component files in your tailwind.config.js file.

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  // NOTE: Update this to include the paths to all of your component files.
  content: ["./app/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  presets: [require("nativewind/preset")],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

- Create a **`global.css`** file and in app folder and then add the Tailwind directives.

```javascript
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

### 3. Add the Babel preset

```javascript
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: [["babel-preset-expo", { jsxImportSource: "nativewind" }], "nativewind/babel"],
  };
};
```

### 4. Modify your metro.config.js

- Generate metro file with following commond

```javascript
npx expo customize metro.config.js
```

- Replace file with this code

```javascript
const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");
const { withNativeWind } = require("nativewind/metro");

const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

module.exports = withNativeWind(config, { input: "./global.css" });
```

### 5. Import your CSS file in **`index.js`** / root file in app

```javascript
import "./global.css";
```

### 6. Modify your app.json

- Switch the bundler to use the Metro bundler

```javascript
{
  "expo": {
    "web": {
      "bundler": "metro"
    }
  }
}
```

### 7. `nativewind-env.d.ts`

- If no `nativewind-env.d.ts` file then create it in root file and add the below code

```javascript
/// <reference types="nativewind/types" />

// NOTE: This file should not be edited and should be committed with your source code. It is generated by NativeWind.
```

## Routing and Navigation

[Documentation Link](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/add-navigation/)

- File-based routing
-

- Stack
- tabs
- Drawer
- Link
- `+not-found.tsx`

- [Types of route notation](https://docs.expo.dev/router/basics/notation/)
  - Simple names/no notation
  - Square [brackets]
  - Group Routes - (Parentheses)
  - index.tsx files
  - \_layout.tsx files
  - +Plus sign

#### Simple names/no notation

- Regular file and directory names without any notation signify static routes. Their URL matches exactly as they appear in your file tree. So, a file named favorites.tsx inside the feed directory will have a URL of `/feed/favorites`.

![alt text](./assets/simple-route.png)

#### Square [brackets]

- If you see square brackets in a file or directory name, you are looking at a dynamic route. The name of the route includes a parameter that can be used when rendering the page. The parameter could be either in a directory name or a file name. For example, a file named [userName].tsx will match `/evanbacon`, `/expo`, or another username. Then, you can access that parameter with the **`useLocalSearchParams`** hook inside the page, using that to load the data for that specific user.

![alt text](./assets/squre-brackets.png)

#### Group Routes - (Parentheses)

- A directory with its name surrounded in parentheses indicates a route group. These directories are useful for grouping routes together without affecting the URL. For example, a file named app/(tabs)/settings.tsx will have `/settings` for its URL, even though it is not directly in the app directory.

- Route groups can be useful for simple organization purposes, but often become more important for defining complex relationships between routes.

![alt text](./assets/parentheses.png)

#### index.tsx files

- Just like on the web, an index.tsx file indicates the default route for a directory. For example, a file named profile/index.tsx will match `/profile`. A file named (tabs)/index.tsx will match /, effectively becoming the default route for your entire app.

![alt text](./assets/index.tsx%20files.png)

#### \_layout.tsx files

- \_layout.tsx files are special files that are not pages themselves but define how groups of routes inside a directory relate to each other. If a directory of routes is arranged as a stack or tabs, the layout route is where you would define that relationship by using a stack navigator or tab navigator component.

- Layout routes are rendered before the actual page routes inside their directory. This means that the \_layout.tsx directly inside the app directory is rendered before anything else in the app, and is where you would put the initialization code that may have previously gone inside an App.jsx file.

![alt text](./assets/_layout.tsx%20files.png)

#### +Plus sign

- Routes starting with a + have special significance to Expo Router, and are used for specific purposes. One example is +not-found, which catches any requests that don't match a route in your app. +html is used to customize the HTML boilerplate used by your app on web. +native-intent is used to handle deep links into your app that don't match a specific route, such as links generated by third party services.

## [Create a development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/create-a-build/)

#### 1. Install expo-dev-client

```javascript
npx expo install expo-dev-client
```

#### 2. Build the native app (Android)

```javascript
eas build --platform android --profile development
```

#### 3. Build the native app (iOS Simulator)

- Add a `development` Profile to `eas.json`
- If you want to use a `development` profile, add it like this:

```javascript
{
  "cli": {
    "appVersionSource": "remote"
  },
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "preview": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      }
    },
    "preview2": {
      "android": {
        "gradleCommand": ":app:assembleRelease"
      }
    },
    "preview3": {
      "developmentClient": true
    },
    "preview4": {
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "production": {}
  }
}
```

Now you can run:

```javascript
eas build --platform android --profile development
```

### Warning: ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Due to runing above code you may face some issues like **`your app is not runing in Expo Go`**, it is using **`development build`**.

### Solution‚ö°Ô∏è:

- ‚úÖ Reset Your Metro Cache

```javascript
npx expo start --clear
```

- ‚úÖ Make Sure You Don't Have a dev-client Installed

```javascript
npm uninstall expo-dev-client
# or
yarn remove expo-dev-client
```

- ‚úÖ Avoid Using --dev-client Flag

```javascript
npx expo start --dev-client ‚ùå
```

Update eas.json file back to this

```javascript
{
  "cli": {
    "appVersionSource": "remote"
  },
  "build": {
    "preview": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      }
    },
    "preview2": {
      "android": {
        "gradleCommand": ":app:assembleRelease"
      }
    },
    "preview3": {
      "developmentClient": true
    },
    "preview4": {
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "production": {}
  }
}
```

## Build APK

- üîó [Build APKs for Android Emulators and devices](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/apk/)
-

#### 1. Create **`eas.json`** file in root folder

```javascript
{
  "cli": {
    "appVersionSource": "remote"
  },
  "build": {
    "preview": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      }
    },
    "preview2": {
      "android": {
        "gradleCommand": ":app:assembleRelease"
      }
    },
    "preview3": {
      "developmentClient": true
    },
    "preview4": {
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "production": {}
  }
}
```

#### 2. Create Account on Expo

- Run following commond

```javascript
eas build -p android --profile preview
```

- Login with the username and password

- If you get `‚ö†Ô∏è zsh: command not found: eas`. ‚úÖ Install `eas-cli` Globally

```javascript
npm install -g eas-cli
```

- Check Version

```javascript
eas --version
```

- Then re-run your build command:

```javascript
eas build -p android --profile preview
```

- ‚ö†Ô∏è keystore Error

```javascript
‚ö†Ô∏è Detected that you do not have keytool installed locally.
‚úñ Generating keystore in the cloud...
Request failed: 500 (Internal Server Error)
Error: build command failed. ‚ö†Ô∏è
```

- ‚úÖ Option 1: Install keytool locally
- keytool comes with the Java JDK, so:

- Install JDK (Java Development Kit) if not already installed:

```javascript
brew install --cask temurin
```

- Then check:

```javascript
keytool - version;
```

- ‚úÖ Option 2: Manually generate a keystore and upload to EAS
  If the cloud generation keeps failing, you can manually create a keystore:

```javascript
keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

Then provide it to EAS via:

```javascript
eas credentials
```

- ‚ö†Ô∏è `gradlew Error` ‚ö†Ô∏è
  ![gradlew](./assets/image.png)
  Warnings  
   ![gradlew img](image.png)

- Fix Issues With following things

- Try to update your npm packages

```javascript
npm update
```

- Run this command to let Expo automatically identify what's incompatible:

```javascript
 npx expo install --check
```

- Run again build commond

```javascript
eas build -p android --profile preview
```

Copy and paste url in browser to download the app.
